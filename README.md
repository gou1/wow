# Resting with my doges

This is a sandbox to create an online service to manage Doge's in Maniaplanet.

It exposes a REST Symfony2 API built with current best practices (FOSRestBundle, JMSSerializerBundle, NelmioApiDocBundle).

A Maniascript application provides a frontend to that API for the Maniaplanet client.
